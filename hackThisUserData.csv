So far I have come across many aps that will display html source code however rather than displaying code for the page as viewed they reload the url and give me the code as viewed by someone without an account - i.e. \you must be logged in to view this page\.Obviously I could just use my desktop but I was hoping to do this in my spare time on buses trains etc and feel it should be within the realms of possibility. And I could theoretically write or amend existing open source browser code to include the functionality to view html source but that would be time consuming (especially for a \noob\ like me).I was wondering if anyone knew of a pre-existing application that would allow me to view the code as required.In the meantime I will continue my search and update as and when (and if) I find any useful information.With many thanks - sadntwisted*** update ***Sorted! I had to save the page as html then view separately. I used SxBrowser available for free on Android market place to save and just the first free html editor in the market place to view. (Please note - this is not an endorsement of SxBrowser despite using it for less than 5 mins I found it annoying. However if there is anyone else in the same boat as me it represents a quick fix.)\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,I am endeavoring to run through the missions using my mobile device operating on the Android OS.

They would only be unlocked if you have x amount of points or do the tutorials.  This would also cut back on "how do I hack?" threads.This something that many many people have asked for and it\s been in high debate in the IRC chat #cofeesh0p for a while now.wow...i LOVE it!! ok i would love to see thiss happen and am willing to do anything i can to help mooka\n\n\t\t\t,-Ninjex- wrote:hellow533 wrote:How about an actual educational mission section.

We\ve had a side project on the to do list for a long time now that would explains each mission in detail with other ways to identify the exploit and from the administrative side how to protect against it. You would be able to see it after completion of the mission.Idea: Those that have made their own custom missions how about you make up a sheet like that? After the challenge is complete you provide a link to full breakdown?\n\n\t\t\t,The idea behind the missions is to give you just a snippet of a clue and push you to research topics not necessarily the exploit itself (well mostly for the basics anyway).

Another thing is if I can load the app and run it in the cloud.See this is a much easier question to answer. In fact the answer is pretty simple -- No. Think about this logically -- When you boot your computer it knows essentially nothing. There is no operating system there to give make it look pretty or allow browsing the Internet or (almost) anything you would normally do. In fact until the BIOS is loaded it literally knows nothing. Once the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) get\s loaded it can now output text on the screen and take basic input. So it knows a tiny bit more but it still has no way of knowing that you want to boot into Ubuntu it doesn\t know where Ubuntu is located or what it is for that matter. It doesn\t know about filesystems and knows extremely little about the peripherals (USB/CD/Monitor/Keyboard/Mouse) you\ve attached to your computer. Then comes the bootloader the thing that tells your computer VERY important information making it quite a bit smarter. Your bootloader can setup a basic filesystem make things look pretty switch into protected mode (don\t need to know what this is but kudos if you do) and load your cool operating system which knows way too much about your ahem Internet ahem browsing habits. Knowing what we do how exactly is your computer supposed to find a specific file on a computer know where to begin execution or anything else necessary to load? How is going to load an application that is meant for your operating system to load? How is it going to connect to a server download a file install that file and begin booting from it? The answer is quite simply it doesn\t/can\t/won\t. You HAVE to tell the computer (before it gets smart) in easy slow and clear language that the place you want to boot from is this CD/USB rather than from the usual spots on your computer. Now everything I\ve said in this post isn\t a absolute. There are always ways of doing things that aren\t meant to be done but for the purpose of this topic it\ll be easier to comprehend if you just imagine them as absolute.You can however install Linux in Windows by using WUBI but that comes with a few downsides and uses a few techniques that I won\t go over in this topic but you might want to look it up as it may help out with your problem.If you need any further clarification feel free to PM me.

It is to RHEL what Fedora Core is to Red Hat that you buy in the store for your PC. CentOS is a really good distribution that includes much of everything.

Naturally neither restricts you to the mode they supply you with. Ubuntu Server can be loaded with GNOME or KDE and likewise Ubuntu Desktop can be stripped of the GUI completely. Linux is Linux and if it\s not then you\ll want to get Linux. As for which is better that\s personal preference.

The SD card is just a storage medium the guy in the store probably set up everything so you can use it so you might want to make a backup first or use another card. Other than that it\s your Pi that hardware was created to play around with! Worst that can happen is that you overwriting your harddisk (in case you fail at dd) or the SD card not booting the Pi and you needing to reformat it to make it work (if dd worked correctly). So ... make sure you know how to use dd (or use a safer program) and you\ll be fine.\n\n\t\t\t,Sure as long as you know what you\re doing with dd (set if and of correctly!) and make sure the OS you dd can be run on the ARM processor of the Raspberry Pi.

Could you tell me why?,86889,Ragna_RocK,All of you are being very kind. Thank you!First of all I believe ghost107 was right. I followed the official tutorial for making a Kali live USB with persistence and everything works fine now (well except for the persistence but that must be because I typed something wrong I am sure of it.)As tripbeam aready explained the steps and even provided the right link there is no use with me repeating it he is right. The problem comes when I (and a couple more people as a google search would tell) install the iso from a Windows OS using Win32 Disk Imager. This program states that the Kali iso is for read only thus it won\t install it. The way I got around that just in case anybody has the same issue was doing it with another program. I used USBWriter and it worked fine with me.After this I followed this tutorial for persistence ( http://ivanbayan.com/index.php/2013/03/ ... partition/ ) which looks easy enough and my "persistence" primary partition is well done. But I probably screwed up at the later steps so I will try again later before assuming anything else.cyberdrain wrote:My experience with Kali and netbooks is that live is probably not the way to go.

If it doesn\t your method of install might be wrong the boot flag might not be set the BIOS doesn\t work the way it should the partition is wrong or your ISO might be corrupted during download (check the hashes). Anything more specific than blank screen with cursor might help I didn\t know this but now that you say it it makes sense. I went for the Kali Live USB with persistence because I travel a lot and I thought I could just carry my USB and be ready to stick it in any computer and start practising.When I am out I sometimes carry the netbook so it would be the main computer used but at home I wouldn\t use the netbook. I wanted to make it persistent so I could install programs and stuff and not having to "start again" everytime I booted from the USB as with a Live USB. Would this be a good setup or should I use a different approach?Oh and sorry for taking so long to answer! As for now I am left with a Live Kali USB (I will try to fix the persistence settings again later) I got carried away and started playing with it. I toyed around with airmon-ng and cracked my wifi password with a wordlist so I forgot about coming back here to post...   Anyways I hope this (long) summary of my newbie adventures can help someone in the future. It was quite fun. Again I want to thank all of you for your kindness. You are a wonderful community if I had known better I would have posted earlier!\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,All of you are being very kind. Thank you!First of all I believe ghost107 was right. I followed the official tutorial for making a Kali live USB with persistence and everything works fine now (well except for the persistence but that must be because I typed something wrong I am sure of it.)As tripbeam aready explained the steps and even provided the right link there is no use with me repeating it he is right. The problem comes when I (and a couple more people as a google search would tell) install the iso from a Windows OS using Win32 Disk Imager. This program states that the Kali iso is for read only thus it won\t install it. The way I got around that just in case anybody has the same issue was doing it with another program. I used USBWriter and it worked fine with me.After this I followed this tutorial for persistence ( http://ivanbayan.com/index.php/2013/03/ ... partition/ ) which looks easy enough and my "persistence" primary partition is well done. But I probably screwed up at the later steps so I will try again later before assuming anything else.cyberdrain wrote:My experience with Kali and netbooks is that live is probably not the way to go. It does not run live Kali very well and crashes if I update anything even with 1 GB RAM. Now my advice would be to run a full install as suggested by tripbeam. You could install Kali as main or dual boot but whatever you do don\t run it live with your specifications. Even if you get it to work now chances are that newer versions of Kali have increased requirements meaning you\re left behind again.

Overall the project has just 4 main functions to it so with enough commitment from everyone involved it can be completed relatively quickly.How to ApplyEmail staff @ our domain (hackthissite.org) with a brief but convincing reason why we should pick you to work with us.  Please do not directly message staff to apply.  Emailing this address makes it easier for all of us to see your application and helps centralize communications.  Put the position you\re applying for in the subject ("Frontend Developer" or "Backend Developer") too please.We are far less interested in resumes and far more interested in examples of your skills.  Github projects Gist or Pastebin pastes whatever.  We want to see what you can do not who you\ve worked for.  This is a volunteer position after all so professional experience isn\t as relevant.  Make your application brief but stand out.  Less than a page with links to concise but good code examples.\n\n\t\t\t,Okay so the title is a bit of a misnomer.

Due to that I have a lot of time to wait. I\ve decided for my project I\m going to make a sample modern version of the HTS website.

When you set yourself up with whatever Windows OS you prefer or decide on do yourself a favor and install a layer 7 based firewall and disable all unused services to close up any unnecessary ports that are not needed.

I will agree that at least for people who dont *want* to learn windows is best. Face it the entire world uses it. That does not make it *the* best - that would be the individuals preference. The orginal question was related to "hacking programming scripting etc" - and Linux suits this far easier then Windows does. Support for numerous scripting and coding languages for starters - you cant say that Windows makes it easy to install developers tools (compilers IDE\s etc) for Ruby Python Perl Java C++ and C during installation. All that has to be found and added from several different developers. Its messy to get support for lots of languages. (BTW @ BuTTHeaD : If you want scripting languages check Perl and Python (any operating system). They\re both powerfull flexible and very nice languages). @liuyuan - IE7 for example it runs at least 2910481920 times faster that\s just a bad example.. Where\d you get that information? What\re you comparing IE7 too? Anybody who runs IE7 is not exactly smart - sure its a hellava lot safer then IE5 but its still not great. Use Firefox. It is foolish to say that you remain an idiot by running Linux. Like it or not like it there are more tools for hacking (check http://www.sectools.org to find lots of examples). Backtrack is an *awesome* example of this: an entire Linux distribution *dedicated* to Pentesting and hacking. Knowing at least the basics of Linux (basic commands directory structure compilation / installation of software etc) is not a bad thing at all. Sticking with Windows forever probably is given the variety of operating systems running worldwide. Sure dont format your windows drive and rush into Linux but at least getting a LiveCD and playing around for a while is a smart move. Anyway. My 2 cents : stick to XP if you dont know what your doing with Linux but get a liveCD (for Ubuntu if you like Windows-like operating systems) or even Backtrack. Especially Backtrack. However @BuTTHeaD : Go and research what Linux is for a while. By your question (not sure if english is your native language) "linux software" isnt normally the terminology used - most people say "linux distibution" and yes there is a difference in those terms. So i am presuming that you dont know much at all about linux. So firstly go and find out what it is and play on a LiveCD for a while. About a 600-700 meg download then run it on your computer without stuffing anything up - it doesnt write to the harddrive at all so you can freely play.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,liuyuan wrote:STICK TO WINDOWS YOU NOOB.I\m serious.

If you want to change some default paths or settings you can do it while you&#8217;re installing.INSTALL AND CONFIGURE KALI LINUX VIRTUAL&#160;IMAGE:- Go to Kali Linux official website and download Kali Linux Virtual Image. Note that you choose the &#8216;VirtualBox Images&#8216; first and then choose according to your OS architecture whether it&#8217;s 64bit or 32bit while you choose the Kali Linux to download.- We have installed virtualbox before installing Kali Linux. After downloading open the Kali Linux Virtual Image by simply hitting left mouse key twice. It&#8217;ll be opened in virtualbox with a pop-up to import it&#8217;s pre-configured settings. Click on the Import button. It&#8217;ll take few minutes to complete.- Once it completes importing settings your Kali Linux is ready to use as a virtual machine.- Remember Kali Linux&#8217;s username is root and password is toor.If you couldn&#8217;t follow how to do it you can follow a complete step by step kali linux virtualbox installation video tutorial.INSTALLING METASPLOITABLE:- Download metasploitable by filling out the following form with your information like I filled in this picture.- Once download completes open it the same way we did as before during the installation of Kali Linux. It&#8217;ll also import the settings same way. Just wait it to complete.- Once it completes importing settings your machine is ready to run.- Remember MetaSploitable&#8217;s username and password is msfadmin.INSTALL MICROSOFT WINDOWS&#160;10:- Download Windows 10. Choose Windows 10 Stable and platform VirtualBox.- After it completes downloading open the image and it&#8217;ll show a pop-up to import settings. - Simply Import it as you have done before in the previous two sections of installing Kali Linux and installing MetaSploitable.- As it&#8217;ll complete importing settings your machine is ready to work.These are all the things we need to do to setup penetration testing lab.

Is there a bigger advantage of being developed by a commercial distribution i.e. RedHatThe only real advantages I see here is that you can rest assured that that flavor won\t be toe-up next week and that it has people getting paid to do the grunt work of making it noob-friendly.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t

Allow me to explain.Windows is a proprietary Operating System and it just so happens to be a widely used standard for applications. Therefore a lot of programs that are also from businesses will be made for a Windows (or Macintosh) platform. Basically if you\re trying to run the Adobe suite from Ubuntu you can forget about it. WINE as far as I know does not support it well and Virtual Box doesn\t have the best graphics based on what I\ve heard which kills the Adobe suite basically. There are other programs where this is true. I just used Adobe as an example.However there are many things you can do with Ubuntu that you can\t do with Windows or that you don\t necessarily have to do with Windows. For example I once read that a trained monkey could install a program on a Windows machine. Not so on a Linux distribution. You need to know what you\re doing. It will be confusing at first (it still is for me sometimes) but eventually you\ll be able to do it. Mind on Ubuntu there\s something called the Synaptic Package Manager which makes it easier to install things but you can install manually. There are also command-line tools that are very useful. I\m not sure about them in Windows but I\m sure that Windows doesn\t come with the BASH shell and you probably can\t install it...As for MS office Ubuntu cannot run it unless you use WINE or something similar. However why would you? It comes with Open Office which is essentially the same thing as MS Office but completely free and (I believe) open-source. That last part means that the source code for the program is publicly available. This probably doesn\t mean much to you now but if you want to learn how computers work it will.As for everything else you mentioned--connecting to networks printers routers etc. of course it can. The good thing about networking is that it involves what\s called abstraction where it doesn\t matter what platform you use. It might take some configuration (as with installation) but you\ll get it and feel proud when it\s done. I recently installed Ubuntu on an EeePC 901 and felt awesome when I figured out how to configure the WiFi.Just as a final note don\t be sorry that you\re new.

Basically it installs Ubuntu Kubuntu or Xubuntu as a windows file. It handles the partitioning and set up of the dual boot and if you mess things up you can always un-install and re-install. I think that this is a great way to get your feet without having to slice up your drive or make changes that may have an effect on your windows install. When you learn more about the operating system then move to a regular install- crawl before you walk and it will save you a large headache later. Also check out http://ubuntuforums.org/ because anything that you could ever have a question about or think about doing in regards to your Ubuntu install someone else has probably asked about in that place.As far as Blu-ray try this link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Restr ... ayAndHDDVD and remember if you are trying to learn linux programming or I guess anything Google is your friend.Good luck\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,If I were you...I would try Wubi.

Didn\t know where this would actually go but it seems this thread would be best for this topic.So I installed Windows 7 on my new laptop about two weeks ago and used a loader to activate it. Then I installed the Avira AV. Everything was fine until a few days ago I now cannot get Avira to update. I also noticed that I\m getting Admin related issues on other programs. ie. I can\t run some programs without using the "run as administrator" option when in fact I\m already on an Administrator account on this computer. I usually get an error message. hmm..apparently It doesn\t do that anymore. No idea how that got fixed. But my main concern is getting Avira to update. It says "error in downloading file".Any ideas?-- Thu Aug 12 2010 2:16 am --Wow. This is freaking me out. Now I can\t start Avira altogether. It just stays there. Stopped. Could I possibly have malware on my computer right now? I mean I went through a whole barrage of "how to secure your computer" lists about a week ago and none of the security software detected anything. Bit Defender doesn\t detect anything at all. Help  1) Did you try uninstalling and reinstalling your AV program?2) You said you used a loader to activate your win7...its never wise to use pirated software but I\m not here to judge.

Here\s the thing about Linux though - it\s nice to have a cool easy to use window manager like KDE and GNOME but the key to learning Linux is knowing the command line/text mode stuff og Linux. So as soon as you get to the login screen press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F1 to get to tty0 now log in with your credentials. Two things now never log in as root and always use sudo for commands that you can\t use unless you\re root. If you don\t have sudo set up then Open Suse isn\t very helpful but you can set it up fairly easily. If you need help let me know. Otherwise you should be able to use your own password to access sudoed commands. This is one of the nice security features of both Fedora Core and Ubuntu. At first site both may seem like they do too much for you or something but if you don\t know how to set up your Linux to be in user-mode then your security may be severely compromised simply because you\re always using your root accout. The reality is that it matters little which Linux you are using - the only differences really are the underlying filesystem structure and what types of packages are used to install new software i.e. RPM or DEB.

You can put all of the same packages on a lot of Linux distros and a lot are even ported to Windows. It\s mostly about preference. Best thing to do is to try them.I have done my homework before posting this on this forum and the best distros for ease of use were apparently Debian and Ubuntu. Backtrack as you mentioned is well known because of the software bundles and all. Either ways I need best of both worlds in terms of relative ease of learning and efficiency...its funny how I never get any hands for windows. Everybody has something against it but nobody is ever specific as to what is wrong. About trying...been there done that mate ...could not make much of a conclusion...cant go in depth on all distros you know...but I will take the advice of the majority and dive into Ubuntu.

This would copy your ENTIRE OS onto that flash drive.  It would also change a few config files/boot loader files/kernel files so that it could be run from that flash drive.  That way you could take your OS (or at least a copy of it) wherever you went.

In the Useful Stuff section of HTS (I guess) you\ll find OllyDbg by which you can track DLL usage and API calls. The Windows API is a very heavy bloat so although it\s possible to port it such project can never be expected to succeed for sure. There is a "freeWin" project called Wine which is now being developed for many years and it still has problems with running certain applications.As one who writes her/his kernel in C has to carry out her/his own implementation of the C runtime library (at least the functions actually used) so do you (if your question was regarding the compiled apps\ API dependency). If your question aimed to find out if you can port the IDE itself then I have to answer "only God knows". No clue which APIs it might be using besides file handling calls (at least ATM).2. Your first task is to present an own GDT as described above. After that I\d implement some basic exception handlers (e.g. print exception number and halt) as they are key elements of debugging your kernel at runtime as well as these stuff will be used later in system security aspects (not to be confused with the user account security and privileges as they are completely different and are way less privileged compared to the kernel: the kernel owns the whole machine while a root user can only do things the kernel gives opportunity via the user interface -- again check out protected mode\s privilege levels).3. No idea. Actually I\ve Googled all my way down the route. Sniffed around pulled a few hundred megs of documents from the web for offline availability mostly tutorials from sites like bona fide and the osdever wiki and specifications tech details about hardware filesystems file formats etc.4. Actually it is up to you what makes you satisfied. These projects can range from (I\ll exclude real mode puffs) simple protected mode kernel with character shell (you\ll need to write a parser then!) or 80x25 textmode windows only one filesystem support and no device driver interface (just a few embedded drivers for the most important hardware like keyboard video and disks) multi/monotasking app management to the full-blown GUI-controlled multi-user multi-processing multitasking/multihreading Plug n Play capable gigaprojects.If you are happy with a character-based interface (lets say a windowed one) preemptive multitasking single-CPU-core system supporting only one filesystem etc. I\d recommend this one. You can hardcode you display driver into the kernel (put 80x25 char CRT management routines in) or even the user interface (you "draw" windows for each app running all appz are somewhat fullscreen use a keycombo to toggle windows other keystrokes for basic functions like "close window and terminate task" or "shutdown" or "show main window" or "show settings panel" etc. I guess you know what I\m saying) and base device drivers. Protected mode for securing system against user apps you use memory area between 1MB and 15MB which is (theoretically) guraranteed to be free no paging. This is quite simple and later on you can extend as you like.You\ll need: GDT an LDT per process (generally same as the GDT but Local not Global) exception handlers and an IDT (again check protected mode tutorials and the Intel 80386 Programmers\ Reference) disk drivers (refer to Floppy and ATA programming manuals) a task management (you just assign metadata structures and some space where to save CPU state to running tasks) a scheduler (you save and restore CPU states to/from memory based on the timer tick IRQ0) and some file handling code that just about wraps it up.1. Have a GDT2. Have an IDT and ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) for exception/interrupt handling3. Reprogram the PIC (to avoid collision with exceptions; put hardware interrupts above INT 1Fh) After this you can STI4. Reprogram the PIT (set it up to generate 100Hz times ticks; this value is common)5. Have a simple memory manager (your version of malloc() and free(); simply take care of contiguous 14MB)6. Have task manager and scheduler7. Have disk- floppy- display- and keyboard handling routines8. Have filesystem handling routines on top of your freshly created "disk drivers"9. Have a visual interface and a "keystroke/command parser" (read keystrokes from a queue put there by the keyboard ISR translate it to ASCII via the keyboard driver i.e. translation routines determine which task it belongs to and put the value on the task\s queue or use it if the keystroke belongs to the user interface)10. Pick a free interrupt line for system calls (Don\t forget the IDT descriptor for it!).

I have grown to despise this os but because the mini doesn\t have a disc drive and it won\t allow me to boot from my external dvd/cd drive I\ve been stuck with this piece of shit os. Earlier today I came across the Joli OS a Linux-based os and discovered it can be installed alongside or over Windows by way of an exe file (that uses the Windows Installer lol). So I installed it alongside Windows 7 (just incase it sucked I wouldn\t be permanently stuck with Joli). When I restarted my comp I was given the choice of starting Windows or starting Joli.At any rate so far this os is pretty awesome and much faster than the Windows on my comp. The only drawback is it utilizes your Jolicloud account (which you register for when setting up the os) to store all your system aps thus you must be connected to the internet to use most of Joli\s aps. However since all your aps are stored online they don\t use up your comp\s space and only slightly affect CPU. There are also some very good programming and coding aps like PHPAnywhere which allows you to code and edit php applications directly online (meaning you don\t need to install PHP SQL Apache or anything else on your local machine to work with PHP.I\m curious if anyone else here has used Joli and if so what was their experience?\n\n\t\t\t,I have an HP Mini 110 that came with Windows 7 Starter.

Willing to help as much as possible if you want !!!-- Fri Aug 12 2011 4:18 am --I did try this several months ago but when I attempted to boot from the USB drive I got the error message "no bootable device". However I\m thinking I may be able to use the Joli OS (since it is a Linux os and loosely based on Ubuntu) to install another Linux os then delete Windows all together. Interestingly the installation process did not partition my hard drive (Joli is on the C drive alongside Windows).Unfortunately and this is one of the major reasons I despise everything Microsoft MS has gone overboard to prevent people from being able to switch operating systems on many of the machines that run Windows (such as removing the function that allows you to open and edit the boot sequence on startup a feature completely removed from my comp) or use certain products on another os (like my Magic Jack that is wholly dependent on a Windows OS).Interestingly most of the computer manufacturers today (Dell HP etc...) have contracts with Microsoft and will not install anything but a MS OS on their computers. I recently contacted HP and asked for some information on switching to Linux on my Mini.

However I\m thinking I may be able to use the Joli OS (since it is a Linux os and loosely based on Ubuntu) to install another Linux os then delete Windows all together. Interestingly the installation process did not partition my hard drive (Joli is on the C drive alongside Windows).Unfortunately and this is one of the major reasons I despise everything Microsoft MS has gone overboard to prevent people from being able to switch operating systems on many of the machines that run Windows (such as removing the function that allows you to open and edit the boot sequence on startup a feature completely removed from my comp) or use certain products on another os (like my Magic Jack that is wholly dependent on a Windows OS).Interestingly most of the computer manufacturers today (Dell HP etc...) have contracts with Microsoft and will not install anything but a MS OS on their computers.

(finally a reply on this thread!)Firstly I\ll explain a few things. The Eee PC comes with a reduced version of Linux - lots of constraints etc.This can be annoying however it does give the advantage that it runs very quickly. It loads up within 20 seconds.Honestly.Now what I\ve done is installed the "Full Desktop" which gives you a desktop basically. It also gives you a start menu (sorry my bad a launch Menu). It gives you everything a normal laptop has basically.However this does slow things down a little - it consumes a bit more RAM and takes 10-20 seconds longer (insanely slow you\ll agree I\m sure  ).As for lag - no not really.As for anything missing - it depends what you\d use it for.If you\re a gamer - don\t expect to be dazzled is all I shall say. It comes with a few games (Linux\s cute 3D penguin racer game is far better than Microsoft Vista\s Chess or XP\s Pinball) however online games are often laggy and sometimes don\t fit properly onto the screen.Personally I will use it for IM IRC etc emails typing reports surfing the internet coding and as a server (a slow one but useful for showing files to people and playing with PHP etc).You can also use it for graphics and sound though I\m not too keen on Gimp and I only use audacity for generating tones.So as far as I am concerned no there\s nothing missing from the Eee. It\s actually my main computer - compact and light.I hope you do get one you won\t be disappointed. If you need any advice etc have more questions and whatnot - just send me a PM or add me on MSN: timdavies3_A-T_hotmail_per-iod_co_per-ioduk &lt;-- Stops spammers just in case you were wondering Hope this helped anyway see you around.~thedotmaster~\n\n\t\t\t,pompalomp2 wrote:The Dot MasterI am considering getting a Asus Eee but i am worried about the performance.

But if you wanna manually do it then you need to download the fil usually in .tar.gz format. From there you need to unpackage it. I\m on my phone so I can\t link very well. Try Googling "installing .tar.gz" or "untarring file" or whatever. That should do you good. Then from there you\ll have to run the config or make install shit depending on what it is. Try googling something like "how to install packages in Slackware" for a better brief overview.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,It depends on what you\re trying to download. if you\re trying to install something then every OS usually has its own commands for downloading and installing: yum apt-get pacman whatever.

Personally I don\t find a need at all to have a gui in linux(Debian 6) which is why I recommended text-mode only(if your using it for the first time you may not want that). I have a dev server I use and just ssh into it from my windows machine. Windows I\ve always used. Linux I\ve used for the past few years but no where near as long as windows.

Polar oposites I know right but I\ve been leaning more towards the computer science for the job factor but is it really worth it? If I\m going to spend four or more years behind some books trying to get a piece of paper I want to know that I\m going to at least earn $100000/year if not more. I do love coding and I know quite a bit now. But there are somethings I just can\t get a grasp on and I believe school could help me and I also know if I tried harder I could probably just teach myself. I guess what I\m trying to ask is this piece of paper worth it?\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t

Even if you get the paper it won\t guarantee 6 figures. But when you are vying for a position against another peer who doesn\t have the degree that piece of paper will make a difference (sometimes the defining difference). And the truth is you want to learn the theories and details behind many of the technologies you want to work worth. There is a great deal of information that many people find difficult to acquire outside of an academic setting and that\s not something you want to miss. (Such details can provide you with the means to that 6 figure position).Also know that 6 figures are hard to make these days even for computer sciences (especially when you are outside big cities). If you are on that level you have to be good at what you do (which leans again towards getting that paper.)Just as a final note a computer science degree will carry more weight than an art degree and will probably be significantly more applicable to your needs.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,It all depends on how you use it.

I think it\s ridiculousness how much you have to pay for something you can easily get yourself but I guess your not actually paying for the knowledge your paying for the peice of paper. Sadly if you want a job you pretty much have to get that piece of paper. So I would recomend the degree for that reason. It is still good to learn on your own as well I have definetly learned far more on my own than I have in college.As far as art/philosophy vs cs cs will have a much better job outlook. At the same time though if you are really into art I would hate to discourage anyone from pursuing their dreams.-- Tue Apr 30 2013 12:17 pm --Also forgot to mention college has many other functions than just earning a degree. You will be exposed to many interesting people and ideas there so it\s also about personal growth.-- Tue Apr 30 2013 12:27 pm --I notice a lot of people thinking about college are concerned with how much money they are going to make. In my opinion fuck money just do what you love. Even if you make tons of money is it worth getting up everyday and working at a job you hate and regreting not having pursued your dreams? With art for instance it is hard to pratically apply that but you could always be an art teacher. Sure you would not be making a ton of money but at least you would be doing something you enjoy.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,I\m currently studying CS and I can honsetly say that one can easily learn everything by yourself as long as it interests you and you are motivated.

This is for the front end dev volunteering that I interviewed with ninjex for:Since I keep hopping on the IRC at bad times I just wanted to let you guys know so you don\t miss my message and to ensure you guys get it. I interviewed with ninjex went pretty well. He asked me to do a project I\ve been really busy the last few weeks just got kicked out of my place to stay and I have about 2 months with a buddy of mine to get a new place to live so I\ve had a really rough past month or so and I\m in a transitional/waiting period for a new job and living quarters. Due to that I have a lot of time to wait. I\ve decided for my project I\m going to make a sample modern version of the HTS website. If you guys would like me to do something different let me know but for now that\s what I\ve decided for my project. Credit to limdis for helping me pick something to do.I really love the concept of this site and I would be a very happy little hacker if our community grows. I think the outdated style of the website kind of draws people away from it or makes them hesitant to use it to learn. and I want to help change that. Sorry I\ve been slacking with this project but like I said I\ve had a really rough past few weeks.Anyways I love this site I would love to be part of your team and I would love to help in any way I can and I hope you guys bring me on to the team. I think working with you guys would be an amazing opportunity and it would help me build my webdev portfolio EXTREMELY but overall I just want to give back to the community.Thank you all for reading I hope you guys have a good day.

Overall the project has just 4 main functions to it so with enough commitment from everyone involved it can be completed relatively quickly.How to ApplyEmail staff @ our domain (hackthissite.org) with a brief but convincing reason why we should pick you to work with us.

I interviewed with ninjex went pretty well. He asked me to do a project I\ve been really busy the last few weeks just got kicked out of my place to stay and I have about 2 months with a buddy of mine to get a new place to live so I\ve had a really rough past month or so and I\m in a transitional/waiting period for a new job and living quarters. Due to that I have a lot of time to wait. I\ve decided for my project I\m going to make a sample modern version of the HTS website. If you guys would like me to do something different let me know but for now that\s what I\ve decided for my project. Credit to limdis for helping me pick something to do.I really love the concept of this site and I would be a very happy little hacker if our community grows. I think the outdated style of the website kind of draws people away from it or makes them hesitant to use it to learn. and I want to help change that. Sorry I\ve been slacking with this project but like I said I\ve had a really rough past few weeks.Anyways I love this site I would love to be part of your team and I would love to help in any way I can and I hope you guys bring me on to the team.

This is for the front end dev volunteering that I interviewed with ninjex for:Since I keep hopping on the IRC at bad times I just wanted to let you guys know so you don\t miss my message and to ensure you guys get it. I interviewed with ninjex went pretty well. He asked me to do a project I\ve been really busy the last few weeks just got kicked out of my place to stay and I have about 2 months with a buddy of mine to get a new place to live so I\ve had a really rough past month or so and I\m in a transitional/waiting period for a new job and living quarters. Due to that I have a lot of time to wait. I\ve decided for my project I\m going to make a sample modern version of the HTS website. If you guys would like me to do something different let me know but for now that\s what I\ve decided for my project. Credit to limdis for helping me pick something to do.I really love the concept of this site and I would be a very happy little hacker if our community grows. I think the outdated style of the website kind of draws people away from it or makes them hesitant to use it to learn. and I want to help change that. Sorry I\ve been slacking with this project but like I said I\ve had a really rough past few weeks.Anyways I love this site I would love to be part of your team and I would love to help in any way I can and I hope you guys bring me on to the team. I think working with you guys would be an amazing opportunity and it would help me build my webdev portfolio EXTREMELY but overall I just want to give back to the community.Thank you all for reading I hope you guys have a good day.

I interviewed with ninjex went pretty well. He asked me to do a project I\ve been really busy the last few weeks just got kicked out of my place to stay and I have about 2 months with a buddy of mine to get a new place to live so I\ve had a really rough past month or so and I\m in a transitional/waiting period for a new job and living quarters. Due to that I have a lot of time to wait. I\ve decided for my project I\m going to make a sample modern version of the HTS website. If you guys would like me to do something different let me know but for now that\s what I\ve decided for my project. Credit to limdis for helping me pick something to do.I really love the concept of this site and I would be a very happy little hacker if our community grows. I think the outdated style of the website kind of draws people away from it or makes them hesitant to use it to learn. and I want to help change that. Sorry I\ve been slacking with this project but like I said I\ve had a really rough past few weeks.Anyways I love this site I would love to be part of your team and I would love to help in any way I can and I hope you guys bring me on to the team.

This is for the front end dev volunteering that I interviewed with ninjex for:Since I keep hopping on the IRC at bad times I just wanted to let you guys know so you don\t miss my message and to ensure you guys get it. I interviewed with ninjex went pretty well. He asked me to do a project I\ve been really busy the last few weeks just got kicked out of my place to stay and I have about 2 months with a buddy of mine to get a new place to live so I\ve had a really rough past month or so and I\m in a transitional/waiting period for a new job and living quarters. Due to that I have a lot of time to wait. I\ve decided for my project I\m going to make a sample modern version of the HTS website. If you guys would like me to do something different let me know but for now that\s what I\ve decided for my project. Credit to limdis for helping me pick something to do.I really love the concept of this site and I would be a very happy little hacker if our community grows. I think the outdated style of the website kind of draws people away from it or makes them hesitant to use it to learn. and I want to help change that. Sorry I\ve been slacking with this project but like I said I\ve had a really rough past few weeks.Anyways I love this site I would love to be part of your team and I would love to help in any way I can and I hope you guys bring me on to the team. I think working with you guys would be an amazing opportunity and it would help me build my webdev portfolio EXTREMELY but overall I just want to give back to the community.Thank you all for reading I hope you guys have a good day.

Overall the project has just 4 main functions to it so with enough commitment from everyone involved it can be completed relatively quickly.How to ApplyEmail staff @ our domain (hackthissite.org) with a brief but convincing reason why we should pick you to work with us.

I interviewed with ninjex went pretty well. He asked me to do a project I\ve been really busy the last few weeks just got kicked out of my place to stay and I have about 2 months with a buddy of mine to get a new place to live so I\ve had a really rough past month or so and I\m in a transitional/waiting period for a new job and living quarters. Due to that I have a lot of time to wait. I\ve decided for my project I\m going to make a sample modern version of the HTS website.

Credit to limdis for helping me pick something to do.I really love the concept of this site and I would be a very happy little hacker if our community grows. I think the outdated style of the website kind of draws people away from it or makes them hesitant to use it to learn. and I want to help change that. Sorry I\ve been slacking with this project but like I said I\ve had a really rough past few weeks.Anyways I love this site I would love to be part of your team and I would love to help in any way I can and I hope you guys bring me on to the team.

What you need to focus on is what they understand. In my case it was money. I could have told them literally anything as long as the threat of damages was high enough and a cost effective solution was viable and quick. We threw in some flash regarding damaging reputations with a handful of charts and it went pretty smoothly. You\ll never get them to fully understand in the time you need. So get flashy tell them how damages would apply to them if exploited and not so much the fine details. Leave that for the white paper.\n\n\t\t\t,Hey man a little late responding so hopefully you can see this before you have to make your presentation. I went through this just last week.

Nothing serious to worry about. When you accidentally delete or lose a partition the data on the partition will become inaccessible.

In future try not to get in trouble with delete recovery partition as for the most part it ain\t hassle but it\s unwanted work.

Wilder\s deadly right hand has gained him 40 knockouts. However in his previous fight with Luis Ortiz the Cuban almost found an answer for Deontay Wilder. In the seventh round of the fight Ortiz landed bombs on Wilder and the American was almost gasped out when the &#8216;bell&#8217; rang. Deontay Wilder got the gift of time and capitalised it solely by knocking out Luis Ortiz. The WBC champion feels that he will knock out Ortiz again their re-match. Take a look at their physical comparisons.Undefeated American Heavyweight World Champion Deontay &#8220;Bronze Bomber&#8221; Wilder will put his WBC belt on the line in a highly anticipated rematch against Cuban contender Luis &#8220;King Kong&#8221; Ortiz on Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and live on FOX Sports Pay-Per-View.The main card will feature two other championship bouts making this a true championship caliber worthy PPV event.The co-main event will be Three-division world champion Leo Santa Cruz going up to the super featherweight division to try to capture a title in his fourth weight class. He will go up against Miguel Flores for the WBA 130 lbs title in what will be a surefire action fight leading into the heavyweight championship main battle.Undefeated newly crowed WBA super bantamweight champion Brandon Figueroa out of Texas will make the first title defense on Saturday against former world champ Julio Ceja.Figueroa has the makings of a future star in boxing he is young undefeated and good looking but Ceja is motivated to dethrone the young champion and spoil his plans of stardom.On Saturday WBC heavyweight champ Deontay Wilder steps into the ring with Luis Ortiz for the second time. The two destructive punchers first met in March 2018 with Wilder scoring a 10th round knockout after some tremendous action. Now they meet again with another huge rematch for Wilder hanging in the balance.Should Wilder (41-0-1 40 KOs) manage to get past Ortiz (31-1 26 KOs) a second time a planned February bout with Tyson Fury would be next up for the champ. Fury and Wilder battled to a draw last December and both men have spent time busying themselves with other opponents ahead of the big-money rematch.Wilder fought Fury in their initial bout after his first defeat of Ortiz. After the draw Wilder took just one round to knock out Dominic Breazeale and set up the Ortiz rematch.Ortiz rebounded from the loss to Wilder by knocking out Razvan Cojanu and Travis Kauffman before decisioning Christian Hammer and earning yet another crack at the Wilder and the WBC championship. At 40 years old Ortiz likely only has a few chances left in his career to fight for a world championship.Before the combatants get into the ring on November 23 they must make weight if they fail to make weight they get fined and can no longer fight for a world title. The fighters must make the agreed upon weight to move forward.Fight fans will enjoy this card from top to bottom because the match-ups have the potential to be fight of the year candidates especially the main event between two heavyweight punchers.Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury have been on a collision course ever since their thrilling first fight ended in a draw in December 2018. The heavyweights decided to each take two interim fights ahead of their rematch reportedly penciled in for Feb. 22.While Fury played it safe by lining up Tom Schwarz and Otto Wallin (the latter turned out to be more difficult than anyone imagined) Wilder (41-0-1 40 KOs) is taking a significant risk with a rematch against Luis Ortiz (31-1 26 KOs) on Saturday in Las Vegas.In their first bout back in March 2018 Ortiz came achingly close to stopping Wilder in a furious seventh round at the Barclay\s Center in New York. The big Cuban was unable to close the deal and Wilder bounced back by knocking out Ortiz with a vicious uppercut in the 10th frame.Wilder must be confident he has Ortiz a top-10 heavyweight all figured out because he\s risking losing his WBC world title three months before a megafight with Fury considered by many to be the division\s lineal champion. A loss would greatly dampen the enthusiasm for that bout and might force promoters to reschedule it so Wilder can try to get his belt back.Ortiz 40 should be laser-focused for this fight. It likely represents his last chance to make history by becoming the first Cuban to win .Saturday\s pay-per-view card also features Leo Santa Cruz taking on Miguel Flores for the vacant WBA super featherweight world title. Santa Cruz has long dominated the featherweight ranks and will now be making his debut at 130 pounds.Wilder\s right hand is the most lethal in the sport a weapon so potent that the 34-year-old has been able to reach the pinnacle of the sport without having to develop a deep repertoire of combinations or perfect his technique.A pawing jab followed by a right cross is elementary stuff but that\s all it takes with Wilder on most nights. His right hand detonated on Dominic Breazeale in the first round of their fight in May sending the 6\7" colossus crumbling to the mat like a skyscraper mid-demolition.

Wilder\s deadly right hand has gained him 40 knockouts. However in his previous fight with Luis Ortiz the Cuban almost found an answer for Deontay Wilder. In the seventh round of the fight Ortiz landed bombs on Wilder and the American was almost gasped out when the &#8216;bell&#8217; rang. Deontay Wilder got the gift of time and capitalised it solely by knocking out Luis Ortiz. The WBC champion feels that he will knock out Ortiz again their re-match. Take a look at their physical comparisons.Undefeated American Heavyweight World Champion Deontay &#8220;Bronze Bomber&#8221; Wilder will put his WBC belt on the line in a highly anticipated rematch against Cuban contender Luis &#8220;King Kong&#8221; Ortiz on Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and live on FOX Sports Pay-Per-View.The main card will feature two other championship bouts making this a true championship caliber worthy PPV event.The co-main event will be Three-division world champion Leo Santa Cruz going up to the super featherweight division to try to capture a title in his fourth weight class. He will go up against Miguel Flores for the WBA 130 lbs title in what will be a surefire action fight leading into the heavyweight championship main battle.Undefeated newly crowed WBA super bantamweight champion Brandon Figueroa out of Texas will make the first title defense on Saturday against former world champ Julio Ceja.Figueroa has the makings of a future star in boxing he is young undefeated and good looking but Ceja is motivated to dethrone the young champion and spoil his plans of stardom.On Saturday WBC heavyweight champ Deontay Wilder steps into the ring with Luis Ortiz for the second time. The two destructive punchers first met in March 2018 with Wilder scoring a 10th round knockout after some tremendous action. Now they meet again with another huge rematch for Wilder hanging in the balance.Should Wilder (41-0-1 40 KOs) manage to get past Ortiz (31-1 26 KOs) a second time a planned February bout with Tyson Fury would be next up for the champ. Fury and Wilder battled to a draw last December and both men have spent time busying themselves with other opponents ahead of the big-money rematch.Wilder fought Fury in their initial bout after his first defeat of Ortiz. After the draw Wilder took just one round to knock out Dominic Breazeale and set up the Ortiz rematch.Ortiz rebounded from the loss to Wilder by knocking out Razvan Cojanu and Travis Kauffman before decisioning Christian Hammer and earning yet another crack at the Wilder and the WBC championship. At 40 years old Ortiz likely only has a few chances left in his career to fight for a world championship.Before the combatants get into the ring on November 23 they must make weight if they fail to make weight they get fined and can no longer fight for a world title. The fighters must make the agreed upon weight to move forward.Fight fans will enjoy this card from top to bottom because the match-ups have the potential to be fight of the year candidates especially the main event between two heavyweight punchers.Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury have been on a collision course ever since their thrilling first fight ended in a draw in December 2018. The heavyweights decided to each take two interim fights ahead of their rematch reportedly penciled in for Feb. 22.While Fury played it safe by lining up Tom Schwarz and Otto Wallin (the latter turned out to be more difficult than anyone imagined) Wilder (41-0-1 40 KOs) is taking a significant risk with a rematch against Luis Ortiz (31-1 26 KOs) on Saturday in Las Vegas.In their first bout back in March 2018 Ortiz came achingly close to stopping Wilder in a furious seventh round at the Barclay\s Center in New York. The big Cuban was unable to close the deal and Wilder bounced back by knocking out Ortiz with a vicious uppercut in the 10th frame.Wilder must be confident he has Ortiz a top-10 heavyweight all figured out because he\s risking losing his WBC world title three months before a megafight with Fury considered by many to be the division\s lineal champion. A loss would greatly dampen the enthusiasm for that bout and might force promoters to reschedule it so Wilder can try to get his belt back.Ortiz 40 should be laser-focused for this fight. It likely represents his last chance to make history by becoming the first Cuban to win .Saturday\s pay-per-view card also features Leo Santa Cruz taking on Miguel Flores for the vacant WBA super featherweight world title. Santa Cruz has long dominated the featherweight ranks and will now be making his debut at 130 pounds.Wilder\s right hand is the most lethal in the sport a weapon so potent that the 34-year-old has been able to reach the pinnacle of the sport without having to develop a deep repertoire of combinations or perfect his technique.A pawing jab followed by a right cross is elementary stuff but that\s all it takes with Wilder on most nights. His right hand detonated on Dominic Breazeale in the first round of their fight in May sending the 6\7" colossus crumbling to the mat like a skyscraper mid-demolition.

Most users need them to find someone for real dating. So after an online dating stage sooner or later people start thinking about meeting in real life. And even if everything has been perfect and smooth and you have a great time via online chat it doesn&#8217;t mean yet that you shouldn&#8217;t forget about safety measures. I don&#8217;t doubt the online dating safety but it&#8217;s better to be safe than sorry. So when taking a decision to move from online to real dating you need to prepare for the first date well and thoroughly.1. Make it formalEven if you have been chatting online for many months and you know probably everything about this person including many moments of life that people usually do not share at once you still should not rush the events no matter how hard you want to make a huge step forward. Your first non-virtual date should be formal no exclusions. Choose a crowded place for the first date for example a restaurant cinema exhibition or agree to meet in a park and spend time there. Do not invite a person to your home nor accept an invitation to visit her house.2. Inform your friends where you are goingI know that it may seem like too much for just a date but you are going to meet a person you have never seen in real life. And informing a friend that you are going for a date with an online match is an absolutely right decision. Besides most dating sites recommend to do it.3. Leave if you feel uncomfortableYour real date may significantly differ from the online ones that you had before. So if you see that your virtual partner is not the person you know so well online you&#8217;d better end this date. Not all online dates should go real. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to leave things as they are and continue communication online.4. Avoid alcoholDo not drink alcohol on the first date. Even if you feel a bit nervous and you know that a little alcohol will help you to relax and calm down. I still recommend you to avoid drinking because you may either create a wrong image of yourself and spoil the date anyways or simply make mistakes.So how safe is online dating? I&#8217;d say that online dating is 100% safe in case you do not neglect the basic rules which work not only for virtual dating but also for the real-world one. Do not rush events take your time avoid conversations about money do not send or buy gifts on request and do not share personal things about you unless you are sure you know a person well enough.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,Very few people who use dating sites consider them only for online communication.

For example a core activity for a consulting organization will be related to business procedures and advisory services like software development will be secondary for which they will need Offshore developers. To handle non-core functions is a distraction so many companies hire offshore development teams to help them develop certain applications that they may need for various business purposes.Besides these benefits there are some disadvantages too like there might occur a problem of improper language and communication work-related norms in that country or misaligned requirements.

I came across a position called a penetration tester which extremely interested me but that just seems so far out of reach for someone in my place. I learn things really quickly and am very motivated I just have no idea what this path looks like. If anyone could please help me and give me some guidance I would greatly appreciate it!!!!

What is CBD oil good for how to choose where to buy it is it safe are there any legal restrictions? Those are the important questions and this website was created specifically to answer them and many more. You will find brief answers below and the more detailed information is available in our reviews of the companies that manufacture and sell CBD products. Providing trustworthy feedback and an overview of such websites is our primary goal.What Does CBD Do?CBD has many applications due to its soothing properties similar to other cannabinoids but without any consequences of psychoactive nature. In other words it won&#8217;t make you high. So this is basically the answer to the question &#8220;Is CBD oil safe?&#8221; People are using it to treat chronic pains sleep disorders anxiety diabetes and other conditions. One of the benefits of this extract is that it can be ingested in various ways and you can choose which one is the most convenient for you and brings the best results.If you are wondering how to use CBD oil for pain there are several options. You can take it directly by putting a certain number of drops under your tongue or as a supplement in your regular food. Since companies usually offer tinctures available in various flavors it makes perfect sense that one would want to try them as is as well as mix them with some other food or drinks.Other popular CBD oil uses are possible due to it being produced as vape juice gummy bears topicals pet treats sprays etc. There seems to be no end to creativity in terms of delivering cannabinoid products to customers and the effects can be quite different so before you go and order all the available options to test on your own look for our reviews to see whether it makes sense to do so with a particular company.Is CBD Oil Legal?Another thing many people who are interested in CBD would like to know is whether it is legal to sell and buy those products especially in those states where marijuana is illegal. If you visit sites that have CBD oil for sale you will notice that most of them offer delivery to all 50 states of the US. How is that possible then?To answer this question we first need to learn how is CBD oil made. Not the entire process no. All you need to know is that there are three types of cannabinoid products:&#10625;\tthose that contain strictly CBD are called isolate and are legal in all states;&#10625;\tfull spectrum oil contains THC among other cannabinoids only allowed in states where marihuana is legalized;&#10625;\tbroad spectrum oil is almost identical to the previous type only it lacks THC (or its content is within the allowed percentage of 0.3%) which also makes it legal in all states.Where Can I Find the Best CBD Oil Prices?Besides the specific cannabinoids in the product it&#8217;s crucial to know that there are no other substances and the purity levels are observed. Unfortunately the industry is relatively new and not regulated yet therefore how can you know that the CBD oil for anxiety you bought on the website promising high potency at lower prices is real?Companies that are concerned about their reputation and are really eager to provide high-quality CBD oil conduct third-party lab testing and make it possible for everyone to check the results for testing that batch on the Internet. What should you do if you don&#8217;t quite understand those results?That&#8217;s what we are here for. We have people with medical background and working experience who will make sense of it all and provide the conclusion for our reviews.

Well students might be involved with other academic activities and works which makes it challenging to write a paper&#8212;writing an article isn&#8217;t an easy task to do. In cases where time is short and the submission date is close you must pay someone to write a paper for cheap.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t

Isn\t that practically the same thing as a "null" value because its a place holder for conjoining columns that don\t have the same amount of tables. That\s the first question regarding null.     2) This question is about table_schema.... is it possible that someone could rename explicitly the "table_schema" part or regardless EVERY server is going to have that as the saved name in the file that holds all the file names?    3) Okay this is the last question and I\m pretty positive that SQL isn\t setup like this but here we go. Anywhom whenever you are searching for a table could there be different tables stored in different directories? Like from what I\ve been learning about unix commands if you search for something in a certain directory and it isn\t in there it will not show up. Do the same principles apply to SQL Injection?

In order to learn you have to do a lot of work on your own.

Ask intelligent specific questions and you will get intelligent specific answers.Now with that out of the way there\s another thing you should know:  You will not be breaking into banks one year from now.  Not only is that not realistic but it\s not something you will learn here.  Again what you see on TV is mostly crap.  People don\t break into banks in 5 minutes to transfer $10000000 to an off-shore account.  It takes a LONG time and a LOT of knowledge to be able to pull that off.

( i m at realistic mission peace poem one)  can these techniques be use in real life ... or  are they to old and so easythat bydefault alldoes injection and javascript are by default blocked ..The only thing near true with what you said that I can think of is that web browsers are now starting to try and disable JavaScript injections via the URL bar by default which will not work since you can easily modify your browser anyway or I am sure many people from the Linux distributions would come together and make a open source browser capable of this anyway. They are trying to do this for security purposes of course but they still give the option to allow it for penetration testing but you must go out of your way to turn it on in some cases.With that being said lets say they did find a way to prevent injections from the URL bar from all browsers period. It will still be useless. I say this because of the realistic mission 8 challenge I beat where you must send money to another account. I made up a little bit of JavaScript injection code and tried to execute it from my URL bar and what do you know my new version of Firefox disabled it by default. So what did I do?

They are trying to do this for security purposes of course but they still give the option to allow it for penetration testing but you must go out of your way to turn it on in some cases.With that being said lets say they did find a way to prevent injections from the URL bar from all browsers period. It will still be useless. I say this because of the realistic mission 8 challenge I beat where you must send money to another account. I made up a little bit of JavaScript injection code and tried to execute it from my URL bar and what do you know my new version of Firefox disabled it by default. So what did I do?

Nothing worked.I would write out javascript:alert(document.forms0.to.value); in the url and nothing; every time.I think now being 2019 vs 2012 when the last post was javascript seems to be blocked automatically in the url.I have javascript enabled through about:config on firefox and nothing happens. Has it now been outdated? I suppose it only works for internal purposes only now.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t,This seems like an old post but I tried doing some javascript injections with one of the basic missions.

They aren\t completely upgradeable you are stuck with whatever you buy and they tend to break easy. I highly suggest a desktop if you can. However laptops are easier to move about so it really depends on your situation.3. Are you going to be gaming?          Games become graphics and ram heavy with exponential growth so that will greatly help determine what specs.4. What is your price range?           Obvious answer.5. Are you comfortable with ordering off the internet?          Places like Newegg are great places to look for deals. But you have to be very careful when ordering off the internet. There are a lot of shotty deals trust me; I dabble in Affiliate Marketing.6. What experience do you have with computers?          If you have little to no experience with computers stay away from linux. You can always dual boot or run it on a virtual machine to gain experience. You really don\t want to deal with that hassle. Windows is a great place for the everyday computer illeterate or novice as it has lots of support from here. Stay away from Macintosh not because of the big controversy but because of the big virus shit storm that will happen to Mac\s soon.7. How long do you want your computer to last?          Quality costs more.8. Do you plan to store a lot of information on your computer?          Specs.9. Do you do any video editing?         Specs also helps with OS decision.10. Are you a quick learner or a dedicated learner?        OS decision.11. Do you give up easily?        OS decision.12. (Optional) If under the age of 18 are your parents buying it for you?
